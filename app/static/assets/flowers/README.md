Place mood/flower images here.

Naming conventions (checked in order):
1. {mapped-mood}.{png|webp|svg} (e.g. happy.png -> mapped to sunflower)
2. {mood}.{png|webp|svg} (e.g. happy.png)
3. {flower_type}.{png|webp|svg} (e.g. sunflower.png)
4. default.{png|webp|svg}

Example filenames:
- sunflower.png
- happy.png
- default.svg

Use PNG/WebP for raster images; SVG is used as fallback. Files are referenced by the client at /static/assets/flowers/<name>.<ext>.
